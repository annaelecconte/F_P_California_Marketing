   1. Introduction
      
This test plan document for https://qasvus.wixsite.com/ca-marketing/
Customers want a perfect website, which passes the full cycle of manual testing. Given the specificity of
the site it is important to have the same quality of the site as per requirements.

2.  SCOPE
The document mainly targets the GUI testing and validating data in report
output as per Requirements Specifications provided by Client.
2.1 Functions to be tested:
● GUI
● Search and Filters Logic
● Performance
2.2 Functions not to be tested.
2.3. Not other than mentioned above in section 2.1.
2.1 Functions to be tested:
● API Server response
● Security


3. QUALITY OBJECTIVES
3.1 Primary Objectives
A primary objective of testing is to: assure that the system meets the full
requirements, including quality requirements (functional and non-functional
requirements) and fit metrics for each quality requirement and satisfies the use case
scenarios and maintain the quality of the product. At the end of the project
development cycle, the user should find that the project has met or exceeded all of
their expectations as detailed in the requirements.
Any changes, additions, or deletions to the requirements document, Functional
Specification, or Design Specification will be documented and tested at the highest

level of quality allowed within the remaining time of the project and within the ability
of the test team.
3.2 Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives of testing will be to: identify and expose all issues and
associated risks, communicate all known issues to the project team, and ensure that all
issues are addressed in an appropriate matter before release. As an objective, this
requires careful and methodical testing of the application to first ensure all areas of the
system are scrutinized and, consequently, all issues (bugs) found are dealt with
appropriately.

4. TEST APPROACH
The approach, that used, is Analytical therefore, in accordance to requirements-
based strategy, where an analysis of the requirements specification forms the basis for
planning,estimating and designing tests. Test cases will be created during exploratory
testing. All test types are determined in Test Strategy.
Team also must used experience-based testing and error guessing utilize testers&#39;
skills and intuition, along with their experience with similar applications or
technologies.
The project is using an agile approach, with weekly iterations. At the end of
each week the requirements identified for that iteration will be delivered to the team
and will be tested.

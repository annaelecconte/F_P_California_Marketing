   1. Introduction
      target
This test plan document for https://qasvus.wixsite.com/ca-marketing/
Customers want a perfect website, which passes the full cycle of manual testing. Given the specificity of
the site it is important to have the same quality of the site as per requirements.

2. SCOPE
The document mainly targets the GUI testing, positive and negative testing, and validating data in report
output as per Requirements Specifications provided by Client.

3. QUALITY OBJECTIVES
A primary objective of testing is to: assure that the system meets the full requirements, including quality
requirements (functional and non-functional requirements) and fit metrics for each quality requirement
and satisfies the use case scenarios and maintain the quality of the product.
The secondary objectives of testing will be to identify and expose all issues and associated risks,
communicate all known issues to the project team, and ensure that all issues are addressed in an
appropriate matter before release.

Entry Criteria
● Proper test data should be available.
● All the necessary documentation, design, and requirements information should be available that will
allow testers to operate the system and judge the correct behavior.
● All the standard software tools including the testing tools must have been successfully installed and
functioning properly.
● All test hardware platforms must have been successfully installed, configured, and functioning
properly.

Exit Criteria

6. SUSPENSION CRITERIA AND RESUMPTION REQUIREMENTS
Suspension criteria
● Software/Hardware problems.
● Significant change in requirements suggested by client.
● The build contains many serious defects which seriously or limit testing progress.
● Assigned resources are not available when needed by test team.
Resumption criteria
● Resumption will only occur when the problem that caused the suspension has been resolved.
7. TEST PLAN
QA role in test process:
● Understanding Requirements.
● Requirement specifications will be sent by client.
Preparing Test Cases:
● QA will be preparing test cases based on the exploratory testing. This will cover all scenarios for
requirements.
Preparing Test Matrix:
● QA will be preparing test matrix which maps test cases to respective requirement. This will ensure the
coverage for requirements.
Reviewing test cases and matrix:
● Review for test cases and test matrix will be conducted by QA Lead.
● Any comments or suggestions on test cases and test coverage will be provided by reviewer
● Suggestions or improvements will be updated by preparer and sent to QA Lead for approval.
● Updates and improvements will be reviewed and approved by reviewer.
Creating Test Data:
● Test data will be created by respective QA based on scenarios and Test cases.
Executing Test Cases:
● Test cases will be executed by respective QA based on designed scenarios, test cases and Test data.
● Test result (Actual Result, Pass/Fail) will be updated in test case document Defect Logging and
Reporting: QA will be logging the defect/bugs in Excel spreadsheet and JIRA, found during execution of
test cases.
Retesting and Regression Testing:
● Retesting for fixed bugs will be done by respective QA once issue is resolved by respective developer
and bug/defect status will be updated accordingly. In certain cases, regression testing will be done if
required.
Deployment/Delivery:
● Once all bugs/defect reported after complete testing is fixed and no other bugs are found,report will be
deployed to the client, along with sample output by email to respective lead and Report group Bug life
cycle:
● All the issues found while testing will be logged into JIRA.
Testing types:

Black box testing – also called behavioral testing or Partition testing. This kind of testing focuses on the
functional requirements of the software. It enables one to derive sets of input conditions that that will fully
exercise all functional requirements for a program.
GUI Testing – GUI testing will include testing of the UI part of report. It covers users Report format, look
and feel, error messages, spelling mistakes, GUI guideline violations.
Exploratory testing – includes a type of software testing where Test cases are not created in advance but
QA checks system “hands-on”. QA may note down ideas about what to test before test execution.
ADHOC testing – includes an informal testing type with an aim to break the system.
Positive testing – includes the type of testing that can be performed on the system by providing the valid
data as input. It checks whether an application behaves as expected with positive inputs.
Negative testing – also known as failure testing or error path testing, is a method of testing an application
or system that ensures that the plot of the application is according to the requirements and can handle
the unwanted input and user behavior. Invalid data is inserted to compare the output against the given
input.
Bug Severity and Priority Definition Bug Severity and Priority fields are important for categorizing bugs
and prioritizing if and when the bugs will be fixed. QA Tester will assign a severity level to all bugs. The
QA Test Lead will be responsible to see that a correct severity level is assigned to each bug.
